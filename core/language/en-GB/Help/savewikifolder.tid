description: Saves a wiki to a new wiki folder

<<.from-version "5.1.20">> Saves the current wiki as a wiki folder, including tiddlers, plugins and configuration:

```
--savewikifolder <wikifolderpath> [<filter>]
```

* The target wiki folder must be empty or non-existent
* The filter specifies which tiddlers should be included. It is optional, defaulting to `[all[tiddlers]]`
* Plugins from the official plugin library are replaced with references to those plugins in the `tiddlywiki.info` file
* Custom plugins are unpacked into their own folder

A common usage is to convert a TiddlyWiki HTML file into a wiki folder:

```
tiddlywiki --load ./mywiki.html --savewikifolder ./mywikifolder
```
