title: TiddlyWeb JSON tiddler format
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The web server API uses tiddlers in a special format originally designed for TiddlyWeb:

* Field values are represented as strings. Lists (like the ''tags'' and ''list'' fields) use double square brackets to quote values that contain spaces
* Tiddlers are represented as an object containing any of a fixed set of standard fields, with custom fields being relegated to a special property called ''fields''
* The standard fields are: ''bag'', ''created'', ''creator'', ''modified'', ''modifier'', ''permissions'', ''recipe'', ''revision'', ''tags'', ''text'', ''title'', ''type'', ''uri''

For example, consider the following tiddler:

```
{
	"title": "HelloThere",
	"tags": "FirstTag [[Second Tag]]",
	"my-custom-field": "Field value"
}
```

In transit over the API, the tiddler would be converted to the following format:

```
{
	"title": "HelloThere",
	"tags": "FirstTag [[Second Tag]]",
	"fields": {
		"my-custom-field": "Field value"		
	}
}
```
