type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The [[web server configuration parameter|WebServer Parameters]] ''host'' is the IP address on which the server listens. The most common settings are:

* ''127.0.0.1'' (default) - only listens for connections from browsers on the same computer 
* ''0.0.0.0'' - listens for connections on all network interfaces, and thus from any browser on a reachable network
* ''n.n.n.n'' - listens for connections on the network interface with the specified IP address

''Note:'' Using ''0.0.0.0'' or ''n.n.n.n'' in a public environment (e.g. coffee shop, library, airport) is inadvisable as it ''will'' expose your system to possible intrusion.
