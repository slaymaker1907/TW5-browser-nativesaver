! Introduction

The ''action-createtiddler'' widget is an [[action widget|ActionWidgets]] that creates new tiddlers. ActionWidgets are used within triggering widgets such as the ButtonWidget.

There are several differences from the [[tm-new-tiddler message|WidgetMessage: tm-new-tiddler]]:

* The new tiddler is not automatically displayed in the [[story river|StoryRiver]]
* The title of the new tiddler is made available for subsequent operations

! Content and Attributes

The ''action-createtiddler'' widget is invisible.

<<.from-version "5.2.0">> The action widgets contained within the ''action-createtiddler'' widget are executed after the new tiddler has been created with the title of the tiddler in the variable `createTiddler-title` and `createTiddler-draftTitle`.

|!Attribute |!Description |
|$basetitle |The initial title that will be attempted. If a tiddler with that title already exists, then a numerical counter is added to the title and incremented until it is unique|
|$savetitle |//(deprecated – see below)// A text reference identifying a field or index into which the title of the newly created tiddler will be stored after it is created |
|$savedrafttitle |//(deprecated – see below)// <<.from-version "5.1.20">> A text reference identifying a field or index into which the draft title associated with the newly created tiddler will be stored after it is created. This is useful when using a sequence of action widgets to create a new tiddler, put it into edit mode, and position it within the list of its parent tag |
|$timestamp |Specifies whether the timestamp(s) of the target tiddler will be updated (''modified'' and ''modifier'', plus ''created'' and ''creator'' for newly created tiddlers). Can be "yes" (the default) or "no" |
|$template |<<.from-version "5.1.22">> The title of a template tiddler, that will be used to create a new tiddler |
|$overwrite |<<.from-version "5.1.22">> If set to "yes", it will overwrite existing tiddlers. ''Be careful!'' |
|//{any attributes not starting with $}// |Each attribute name specifies a field to be created in the new tiddler  |

<<.from-version "5.2.0">> Note that the attributes `$savetitle` and `$savedrafttitle` are no longer needed. Instead, any action widgets that need to use the title of the newly created tiddler should be contained within the ''action-createtiddler'' widget, and reference the variables `createTiddler-title` and `createTiddler-draftTitle` to obtain the title.
