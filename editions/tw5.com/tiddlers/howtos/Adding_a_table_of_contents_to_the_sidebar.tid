title: Adding a table of contents to the sidebar
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The standard mechanisms in ~TiddlyWiki for creating Table-of-Contents are macros known collectively as "toc" [[macros|Macros]] (click on link to learn more about macros). They use `Tagging` as their means of creating relationships, so be sure to review the [[Tagging]] topic tiddler if tagging is a new concept for you.

A customisable [[table of contents|Table-of-Contents Macros]] can be added to the sidebar with the following steps:

# Create a tiddler called [[TableOfContents]]
# Give it the tag ''~$:/tags/SideBar''
# Set the text to <div><pre><code><$text text="""
<div class="tc-table-of-contents">

<<toc-selective-expandable 'TableOfContents'>>

</div>"""/></code></pre></div>
# Add a ''caption'' field with the text ''Contents''
# Add a ''list-after'' field with the text ''~$:/core/ui/SideBar/Open''

Add entries to the table of contents by creating tiddlers tagged ''~TableOfContents''. An easy way is to choose <<.icon $:/core/images/new-here-button>> ''new here'' from the tiddler toolbar of the ''~TableOfContents'' tiddler. 
(if you don't see the "new here" button, click on the down arrow <<.icon $:/core/images/down-arrow>> to see more menu options.)

To create child tiddlers (tiddlers that come below other tiddlers), tag them with the name of the parent tiddler.
