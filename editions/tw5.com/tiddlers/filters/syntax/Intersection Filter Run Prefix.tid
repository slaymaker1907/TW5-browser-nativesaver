|''purpose'' |find the intersection of titles from previous runs with titles in this filter run |
|''input'' |all titles from previous filter runs |
|''output''|the titles that are present in both the result of this filter run and the output from previous runs |

The filter output from previous runs is set aside. The `:intersection` filter run is started with all tiddler titles as input. Once this latest filter run has completed, the latest output is compared to the set-aside output. A new output is produced that contains only titles that appeared in both the set-aside output and the latest output.
