[[TiddlySpot|http://tiddlyspot.com]] is a free hosting service for TiddlyWiki documents from Simon Baird and Daniel Baird.

! Setting up a TiddlyWiki on ~TiddlySpot
To set up a [[TiddlyWiki Classic|TiddlyWikiClassic]], you merely create a new wiki at http://tiddlyspot.com

!!TiddlyWiki5 on ~TiddlySpot
~TiddlyWiki5 also functions well on ~TiddlySpot but this version is not offered directly in the ~TiddlySpot set-up.

The simplest way to create a new ~TiddlySpot with ~TiddlyWiki5 is probably through the community created site http://tiddlywiki5.tiddlyspot.com

Alternatively, you can upload an existing ~TiddlyWiki5 document from your local disc to ~TiddlySpot by following these steps:

# Sign up for a new wiki at http://tiddlyspot.com/, and remember the wiki name and password
# Open your locally stored TiddlyWiki document in your browser
# Fill in the ~TiddlySpot wikiname and password in ''Saving'' tab of the ''control panel'' <<.icon $:/core/images/options-button>>
# Click the <<.icon $:/core/images/save-button>> ''save changes'' button. You should get a confirmation notification at the top right saying ''Saved wiki''. Saving can take several seconds if you're on a slow connection or working with a large wiki.
# Navigate to your ~TiddlySpot URL at http://{wikiname}.tiddlyspot.com/

Note that your password is sent unencrypted when using ~TiddlySpot. From http://faq.tiddlyspot.com/:

''Is Tiddlyspot secure?''

No. Tiddlyspot does not use SSL/https. Your password is sent in clear text when uploading and when authenticating to access a private site. This means that your Tiddlyspot is vulnerable to packet sniffing and your password could be discovered by a malicious third party. Also your data is transmitted unencrypted when you view your site, even if it is a private site. For this reason please don't put sensitive information such as banking details in your Tiddlyspot and don't use a password that you use for other high security sites.

! Problems with saving on ~TiddlySpot

In case you run into this error when uploading a new or freshly upgraded local TiddlyWiki to ~TiddlySpot :

<<<
Error while saving:

Error:NS_ERROR_DOM_BAD_URI: Access to restricted URI denied
<<<

The upgrade operation falls foul of a security restriction in Firefox. Until this can be resolved, we suggest using Chrome.

*# Use Chrome to open the local TiddlyWiki document you want to upload to ~TiddlySpot and follow the steps 1 through 5 described above
*# Once you've checked the ~TiddlySpot-hosted TiddlyWiki loads properly in Chrome, you should be able to access, edit and [[save using TiddlyFox|Saving with TiddlyFox]] again
* After you've uploaded your local document once, further editing and saving of the online version hosted on ~TiddlySpot should work with any modern browser of your choice.
** Don't forget to fill in the ~TiddlySpot wikiname and password in your ~TiddlySpot TiddlyWiki control panel for any new browser you want to use for saving changes
