title: $:/plugins/tiddlywiki/freelinks/readme

This plugin adds automatic generation of links to tiddler titles.

''Note that automatic link generation can be very slow when there are a large number of tiddlers''.

Freelinking is activated for runs of text that have the following variables set:

* `tv-wikilinks` is NOT equal to `no`
* `tv-freelinks` is set to `yes`

Freelinks are case sensitive by default but can be configured to ignore case in the settings tab.

Within view templates, the variable `tv-freelinks` is automatically set to the content of $:/config/Freelinks/Enable, which can be set via the settings panel of this plugin.

!! Notes

To change within which tiddlers freelinking occurs requires customising the shadow tiddler [[$:/plugins/tiddlywiki/freelinks/macros/view]]. This tiddler is tagged $:/tags/Macro/View  which means that it will be included as a local macro in each view template. By default, its content is:

```
<$set name="tv-freelinks" value={{$:/config/Freelinks/Enable}}/>
```

That means that for each tiddler the variable tv-freelinks will be set to the tiddler $:/config/Freelinks/Enable, which is set to "yes" or "no" by the settings in control panel.

Instead, we can use a filter expression to, say, only freelink within the tiddler with the title "HelloThere":

```
<$set name="tv-freelinks" value={{{ [<currentTiddler>match[HelloThere]then[yes]else[no]] }}}/>
```

Or, we can make a filter that will only freelink within tiddlers with the tag "MyTag":

```
<$set name="tv-freelinks" value={{{ [<currentTiddler>tag[MyTags]then[yes]else[no]] }}}/>
```

Or we can combine both approaches:

```
<$set name="tv-freelinks" value={{{ [<currentTiddler>match[HelloThere]] ~[<currentTiddler>tag[MyTag]] +[then[yes]else[no]] }}}/>
```
