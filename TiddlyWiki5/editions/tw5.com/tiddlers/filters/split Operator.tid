<<.from-version "5.1.20">>

Note that in some circumstances the <<.op split>> operator will include blank items in the list of results. For example, 

```
[[the band thethe are the best the]split[the]]
```

The following results are returned:

```
["", " band ", "", " are ", " best ", ""]
```

Where it might be expected that the results would be:

```
[" band ", " are ", " best "]
```

The blank items mark the boundaries between matches. If they are not required they can be removed with the ''blank'' category of the [[is Operator]]: `[[the band thethe are the best the]split[the]!is[blank]]`.

The reason that the blank items can be useful is that they allow search and replace operations to be constructed from a combination of the [[split Operator]] or [[splitregexp Operator]] and the [[join Operator]]. For example:

<<.operator-example 1 "[[the band thethe are the best the]split[the]join[every]]">>

<<.operator-examples "split">>
