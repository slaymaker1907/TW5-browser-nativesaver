title: Insert picture

This will give you a dialog to search for and pick existing image tiddlers in the wiki. When you pick a tiddler it will be inserted as a WikiText  image link where the cursor is in the text field.


Pressing <<.icon $:/core/images/picture>> will give you `[img[$:/favicon.ico]]`
