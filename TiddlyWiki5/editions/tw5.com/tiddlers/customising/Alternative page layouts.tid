! Creating an alternative page layout

Creating an alternative layout goes beyond [[adding or removing features|Page and tiddler layout customisation]] from the default interface and allows you to create an entirely new layout from scratch.

To create an alternative page layout and have the ability to switch to it, you need to create an alternative page template tiddler with the [[SystemTag: $:/tags/Layout]].

This alternative page template can either be a tweaked and modified version of the [[default page template|$:/core/ui/PageTemplate]], or something entirely different. The layout switching mechanism requires that your page template tiddler has the fields `name` and `description`, which are used in the listing in the switching user interface.
