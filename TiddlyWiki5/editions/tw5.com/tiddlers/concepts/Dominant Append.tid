title: Dominant Append
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

[[Filters]] manipulate [[sets of titles|Title Selection]] in which no title may appear more than once. Furthermore, they often need to append one such set to another.

This is done in such a way that, if a title would be duplicated, the earlier copy of that title is discarded. The titles being appended are dominant.

For example, if a selection contains `Andrew Becky Clara Daniel` and `Andrew Barney Clara Daisy` is then appended to it, the result is `Becky Daniel Andrew Barney Clara Daisy`.

This behaviour can cause unexpected results when working with [[Mathematics Operators]]. For example, `1 2 3 +[sum[]]` evaluates to `6`, as expected. But `1 1 1 +[sum[]]` evaluates to `1`. Removing the `+[sum[]]` from each filter reveals the problem: `1 2 3` evaluates to the list `1`, `2`, `3`, while `1 1 1` evaluates to the single item `1` due to de-duplication.

In such situations, the `=` prefix can be used to disable the de-duplication. For example, `=1 =1 =1 +[sum[]]` evaluates to `3` as expected. Alternatively, the [[split Operator]] can be used: `[[1,1,1]split[,]sum[]]`.
