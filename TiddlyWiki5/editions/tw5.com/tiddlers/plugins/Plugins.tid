Plugins in TiddlyWiki5 can be used to distribute optional components that customise and extend TiddlyWiki. You can install them from the [[official plugin library|Installing a plugin from the plugin library]] or from [[community sites|Resources]].

{{$:/core/ui/ControlPanel/Plugins/AddPlugins}}

Internally, plugins are a bundle of tiddlers packaged together as a single tiddler that can be installed, copied or deleted as a unit. The individual tiddlers within a plugin appear as ShadowTiddlers. See the PluginMechanism discussion for more details about how plugins are implemented internally.

Plugins can contain JavaScript modules, style sheets, and templates. Plugins can also be used to distribute ordinary text, images or any other content.
