<<.from-version "5.1.18">> The [[system tag|SystemTags]] `$:/tags/RawMarkupWikified/TopBody` marks wikified tiddlers to be included as raw markup at the top of the `<body>` section in the generated HTML file.

Note that the wiki must be saved and reloaded in order for a raw markup tiddler to take effect. Also note that global macros are not available by default within raw markup tiddlers; you can use the ImportVariablesWidget to explicitly import them.
